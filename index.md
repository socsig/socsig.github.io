description: Overview

We make bespoke tools that help you understand the complex, interconnected behavior of 
humans and algorithms interacting under the influence of distributed control systems.

You want to understand how your company's popularity grows and wanes - and, most importantly, *why* it does.
Or maybe you're interested in predicting large fluctuations in consumer demand over a variety of timescales. 
Perhaps you just need some straight talk about what statistical methodology suits your experimental conditions best.

We have your back. Our team of scientists has years of experience in a variety of fields, from defense contracting, embedded software, and algorithmic finance to computer security and social media analysis.
 A common thread that runs through all of us is a
deep belief that data can lead us to truth - we just need to use the right tools to peer through the noise.
