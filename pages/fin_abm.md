title: Agent-based modeling
description: Agent-based modeling
---
We are actively developing a financial market agent-based model that includes
- Static and evolvable trading agents
- A fully-functional matching engine using a modified version of a frequent batch auction. Proprietary versions of this matching engine are suitable for use in an alternative trading system or any new market-based mechanism that you can imagine!
- Simulation peripherals allowing for easy hypothesis testing and parallel code execution

An open-source version of the code underlying this model is available [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/daviddewhurst/dragonbridge-abm). 
For bespoke implementations and extensions tailored to your usage needs, please contact
