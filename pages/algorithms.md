description: Current suite of algorithms to help you solve hard problems
---

We have developed a suite of algorithms (some proprietary, some open-source) for time series analysis, inference
and prediction. In addition, we develop agent-based models that can be invaluable for generating data to
 describe situations that haven't happened yet, which can be invaluable for risk analysis or 
"what-if" business planning.


### Off-the-shelf solutions
- [Functional time series anomaly detection](shocklets.html)
- [Agent-based market microstructure models](fin_abm.html)

### Bespoke algorithms
We offer a wide range of consulting services and are able to create custom signal-processing and information extracttion algorithms for high-dimensional __time series__, panel, and __natural language__ data. 
Visit [our consulting page](statistical_consulting.html) for a technical overview of these services, or 
contact us at <consulting@sociotechnicalsignals.com> for a personal follow-up.
